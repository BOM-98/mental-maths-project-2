## Introduction

Welcome to Mental Maths Trainer, a fun and flexible online tool that may be used to assist individuals improve their mental arithmetic abilities. Young pupils and adults looking to advance their mental agility and mathematical skill are both welcome on the platform.

In order to keep users interested and challenged, Mental Maths Trainer provides a dynamic environment for learning addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with problems that automatically increase in complexity. Our application maximizes learning potential by following the [85% rule for optimum learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12552-4), to ensures that users experience the right balance of success and challenge, maximizing their learning potential. Users will progress through the app until they reach a level where they are not getting the right answer approx 15% of the time. 

It has been demonstrated that practicing mental arithmetic improves cognitive functioning and neuroplasticity. Users who regularly practice mental arithmetic can get a variety of advantages in addition to better math abilities. Improved working memory, attention, and processing speed have all been shown as a result of practicing mental arithmetic, according to [research](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-26807-001).

The brain' ability to grow new neurons to adapt to a stimulus, known as neuroplasticity, is a key driver in developing mental arithmetic skills. Studies show that performing cognitive activities like mental addition and subtraction can boost neuroplasticity, [leading to stronger connections between neurons and improved brain function](see https://www.nature.com/articles/427311a).

The Mental Maths Trainer is an online application that will offer several advantages, including higher performance in daily activities, increased neuroplasticity, and improved cognitive capacities. Users may get these benefits and see a good influence on their general cognitive development and daily lives by regularly practicing mental arithmetic with Mental Maths Trainer. Users will be working in an optimal environment that maximizes the development of their working memory, problem-solving skills, and task-focus.

The game has no end, the goal is to reach level 18 of the game, but if someone reaches level 18 they can continue for as long as they wish. This is to avoid putting restrictions on how long someone would like to train for.

## Design Choices

### Target Personas

#### General Target Audience

- Age: 18-60
- Profession: Disciplines that require focused concentration for long periods of time, and typically can tax working memory and problem solving skills. People still in education would not be considered part of the target audience as they are still engaged in continuous learning and do not have as much of a need to 'work out' their brains in the general sense. 
- Motivation: Either to improve the general congitive capacities of the human brain for application in work and everyday life or to specifically improve arithmatic abilities due to embarrasment or fear over an inability to perform mental calculations.

All design decisions incorporated into the web app were made keeping these target personas and their problems, motivations and jobs to be done in mind. 

### Colour Scheme

1. Background Color: Anti-flash white (#F3F4F5)
   - This off-white color maintains a clean, neutral backdrop for content while reducing eye strain caused by the high contrast of pure white. It also maintains sufficient contrast with the text color (Dark Gray) to ensure readability and accessibility.

2. Secondary Color / Text Color: Eerie black (#1E1E1E)
   - A softer alternative to black that maintains high contrast with the white background for easy readability.

3. Primary Color: Argentinian Blue (#67AEF4)
   - A lighter, more approachable shade of blue that complements the primary color. It can be used for buttons, links, and other interactive elements to create a sense of engagement and accessibility. Represents trust, professionalism, and intelligence. Perfect for conveying the educational and cognitive improvement aspects of the website.
   
4. Highlight Color: Lime Green (#09CE28)
   - A sharp green colour to draw attention to the most important statistics the user will need to keep in mind. This colour can be adjusted in opacity to create a softer feel on the eyes, while maintining its contrast with other elements. This colour will be used sparingly to maintain its importance. 

5. Warning Color: Red (#FF0000)
   - A sharp color to draw attention to timers that are about to run out or scores that have fallen low. This red will only be displayed dynamically as indicators on the screen show the user is running out of time or performing poorly.

Accessibility and contrast considerations:

When designing the website, it's crucial to ensure that the color contrast ratios meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards. This will guarantee that users with visual impairments can easily access and navigate the site.

In this color palette, the primary color (Argintinian Blue) and secondary color (Eerie black) provide sufficient contrast against the white background. However, the highlight color (Lime Green) is used sparingly and with caution, as it may not provide enough contrast against the white background for some users.

Overall, this color palette provides a professional, engaging, and accessible experience for users, ensuring that the site's design aligns with its purpose and target personas.

![Colour Palette](https://github.com/BOM-98/mental-maths-project-2/blob/main/assets/images/P2-colour-pallette-image.png)

### Typography

1. Primary Heading (H1):
- Font Family: Montserrat
- Justification: Montserrat is a contemporary, geometric sans-serif typeface that is inviting and professional. It is appropriate for both target personas because to its clear lines and softened edges, which give a feeling of clarity and approachability.

2. Secondary Heading (H2):
- Font Family: Open Sans
- Justification: Open Sans is a humanist sans-serif font family that is adaptable and has high readability. It pairs nicely with Montserrat and performs well for subheadings, making it simple for readers to distinguish between content levels while upholding a uniform visual look.

3. Tertiary Heading (H3) and Body Text:
- Font Family: Roboto
- Justification: Roboto is a highly readable, neo-grotesque sans-serif typeface that was created especially for digital interfaces. Its readability and welcoming appeal make it a great option for body text and tertiary headers, ensuring that both target personas can quickly access the material.

4. Accent Text (quotes, callouts, etc.):
- Font Family: Lato
- Justification: Lato is a warm, humanist sans-serif typeface that gives accent text a dash of class and finesse. It blends in nicely with the other font families and aids in underlining crucial information without interfering with the website's overall aesthetic harmony.

### Wire Frames
I created my wireframe using Figma.

#### Desktop Page

The home page was designed to show only pertinent information on the screen. Statistical indicators including time, level and quesiton number are displayed across the top. On the very right of the statistics container a box displays the current percentage of questions the user is getting correct and on time. the user will need to keep this score above 85% to progress to further levels. 

The center of the page features the sum to be answered and the input box that the user can use to answer the question. 

![Wireframe1](https://github.com/BOM-98/project_1/blob/main/assets/images/desktop-wireframe.png)

#### Phone Page

The mobile version condenses the statistics together and displays them as a column to improve the aesthetics of the layout.

### Sitemap

A sitemap was generated using [xml-sitemaps.com](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/details-bom-98.github.io-4988e25b7.html). This was added to the root directory. 

Here is a general overview of the Sitemap: 

- 1. [Home](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/)
- 2. Resources 
	- 2.1 [Ideation](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/ideation.html) 
	- 2.2 [Customer Discovery](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/customer_discovery.html)
	- 2.3 [Fundraising](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/fundraising.html) 
	- 2.4 [Blog Home](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/blog-home.html)
- 3. [Newsletter Signup](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/newsletter_signup.html)
- 4. [Thank You](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/thank_you.html)

To rank the website on Google Search, a Google HTML file was added to the root directory (/workspaces/project_1/googleb4228df491edf6c8.html). I did not rename this file to something shorter and more readable as I was concerned about Google's ability to identify the file and verify the site if I did. 

A visual skeleton of the website is shown in the below image.

![sitemap](https://github.com/BOM-98/project_1/blob/main/assets/images/README_images/site-map-project-1.png)

The sitemap was uploaded to Google Search Console to improve page ranking on Google search.

![Sitemap Upload](https://github.com/BOM-98/project_1/blob/main/assets/images/README_images/sitemap-submission-approval.png).

A sitemap HTML tag was also added to the root repository to enable Google to validate the site ownership.

### Features Left to Implement

-   I would have liked to connect the newsletter forms to an actual mailing list to enable users to receive new content regularly. This would involve creating a backend database and APIs to collect and store the user information, in addition to integrating with mailing software such as MailChimp to email new subscribers. 
-  I would like to make a full blog editor where I can quickly add new blog pages with the same layout and style without having to manually create a new page by writing HTML and CSS. This would involve creating an admin page where I could write new articles and publish them to the site. Information on how to do this is provided in the following [link](https://dev.to/themodernweb/fullstack-how-to-create-a-working-blogging-website-with-pure-html-css-and-js-in-2021-9di.).

## Technologies Used: 

I used the following technologies, platforms and support in building my project: 

- I used [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), an extension within Visual Studio Code to visualize and test my website as I was creating it.
- Adobe Illustrator was used to edit the .EPS documents created by [catalyststuff](https://www.freepik.com/author/catalyststuff).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was the IDE used to create the website.
- [Github](https://github.com/) was used for the project repository.
- Git was used for version control.
- Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

## Testing

To ensure the site functions appropriately I conducted several tests. This includes HTML, CSS, and Javascript testing.

### Manual Testing

- For each new page implementation
    - every page link was checked to make sure they redirected to the correct source.
    - every element was checked to make sure they were sized correctly and resized as expected with different screen dimensions.
    - external links were checked to make sure they opened a new tab and directed to the correct source.
    - forms were checked for defensive coding (field validation, error message for wrong input and mandatory fields) and correct submission redirects to the thank you page.
    - Google dev tools were checked to make sure there was no errors logged to the console for any Javascript functions that were invoked.
    - compatibility tests were done for different browsers.
- I received additional manual testing help on the #peer-code-review channel to make sure all links and javascript functions worked as intended.

## Deployment

-   The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    -   Before deployment, I edited my working directory using Visual Studio Code Remote Explorer. 
    - I added my files to the staging area using the 'git add .' command in the terminal.
    - Once files were added to the staging area, I committed my files using 'git commit -m 'my message'.
    - Once my changes had been committed, I pushed the changes to the remote repository using 'git push' in the terminal. 
    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
    -   From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
    -   Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful .deployment.
