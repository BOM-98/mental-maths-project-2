## Introduction

Welcome to Mental Maths Trainer, a web application designed to help people sharpen their mental arithmetic skills in an engaging and adaptive manner. Our platform caters to learners of all ages, from young students to adults seeking to improve their mental agility and mathematical prowess.

Mental Maths Trainer offers a dynamic environment for practicing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with problems that automatically adjust in difficulty to keep users challenged and engaged. By adhering to the [85% rule for optimal learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12552-4), our application ensures that users experience the right balance of success and challenge, maximizing their learning potential.

Mental arithmetic training has been shown to have a positive impact on cognitive abilities and neuroplasticity. By engaging in regular mental arithmetic exercises, users can experience a range of benefits beyond just improved math skills. Research suggests that practicing mental arithmetic can lead to enhancements in overall cognitive abilities, such as [working memory, attention, and processing speed](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-26807-001).

Neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to new experiences, also plays a significant role in mental arithmetic training. Studies have shown that engaging in cognitive tasks like mental arithmetic can increase neuroplasticity, [leading to stronger connections between neurons and improved brain function](https://www.nature.com/articles/427311a).

The Mental Maths Trainer is a web app that will provide numerous benefits, including enhanced cognitive abilities, increased neuroplasticity, and improved performance in everyday tasks. By engaging in regular mental arithmetic practice using Mental Maths Trainer, users can unlock these advantages and experience a positive impact on their overall cognitive development and daily life. Users will work in an enviroment that optimizes their ability to improve their working memory, problem solving abilities, and ability to focus on tasks.

## Design Choices

### Target Personas

#### General Target Audience

- Age: 18-60
- Profession: Disciplines that require focused concentration for long periods of time, and typically can tax working memory and problem solving skills. People still in education would not be considered part of the target audience as they are still engaged in continuous learning and do not have as much of a need to 'work out' their brains in the general sense. 
- Motivation: Either to improve the general congitive capacities of the human brain for application in work and everyday life or to specifically improve arithmatic abilities due to embarrasment or fear over an inability to perform mental calculations. 

#### Target Persona: Jessica, the Busy Professional

1. Problem:
Jessica struggles with mental arithmetic, which affects her confidence and ability to make quick calculations in her daily life. She often relies on calculators or smartphone apps to solve even simple math problems, which can be time-consuming and inefficient.

2. Motivation:
Jessica wants to improve her mental arithmetic skills to increase her confidence, enhance her cognitive abilities, and be more efficient in her professional and personal life. She seeks an engaging, adaptive, and accessible platform that fits her busy schedule and provides a challenging yet achievable learning experience.

3. Demographics:
- Age: 32 years old
- Gender: Female
- Occupation: Marketing Manager
- Education: Bachelor's degree in Business Administration
- Location: Urban area, Ireland

4. Jobs to be done:
- Find a convenient and engaging platform to practice mental arithmetic regularly.
- Improve mental arithmetic skills to tackle problems in daily life with confidence and ease.
- Enhance cognitive abilities, such as working memory, attention, and processing speed, to improve overall decision-making and problem-solving.
- Track progress and achievements to stay motivated and celebrate milestones.
- Access a learning platform that adapts to her skill level, providing an optimal balance of challenge and success.
- Incorporate mental arithmetic training into her daily routine seamlessly, without disrupting her busy schedule.

#### Target Persona: Michael, the Finance Enthusiast

1. Problem:
Michael is interested in training his brain and improving his overall cognitive abilities to excel in his finance career and personal life. While he is proficient in arithmetic, he seeks to enhance his mental agility and problem-solving skills through regular mental exercises.

2. Motivation:
Michael wants to engage in challenging mental activities that will not only sharpen his arithmetic skills but also contribute to his overall cognitive development. He is looking for a platform that offers diverse mental challenges and adapts to his current skill level, providing an optimal learning experience.

3. Demographics:
- Age: 40 years old
- Gender: Male
- Occupation: Financial Analyst
- Education: Master's degree in Finance
- Location: Urban area, United Kingdom

4. Jobs to be done:
- Discover a platform that offers engaging mental exercises to improve overall cognitive abilities, including memory, attention, and processing speed.
- Enhance mental arithmetic skills to maintain and further develop his proficiency in financial calculations.
- Participate in a learning experience that adapts to his skill level, providing an optimal balance of challenge and success.
- Track progress and achievements to stay motivated and measure improvements in cognitive abilities.
- Integrate regular mental training into his daily routine without disrupting his work-life balance.
- Utilize improved cognitive skills to excel in his finance career and tackle everyday challenges with greater ease and confidence.

All design decisions incorporated into the web app were made keeping these target personas and their problems, motivations and jobs to be done in mind. 

### Colour Scheme

1. Primary Color: Navy Blue (#1c3d5a)
   - Represents trust, professionalism, and intelligence. Perfect for conveying the educational and cognitive improvement aspects of the website.

2. Secondary Color: Sky Blue (#71a6d2)
   - A lighter, more approachable shade of blue that complements the primary color. It can be used for buttons, links, and other interactive elements to create a sense of engagement and accessibility.

3. Accent Color: Coral (#ff6b6b)
   - A warm, energetic color that contrasts with the blue tones. It can be used to highlight important information, call-to-action buttons, or progress indicators.

4. Background Color: Off-White (#f5f5f5)
   - This off-white color maintains a clean, neutral backdrop for content while reducing eye strain caused by the high contrast of pure white. It also maintains sufficient contrast with the text color (Dark Gray) to ensure readability and accessibility.

5. Text Color: Dark Gray (#333333)
   - A softer alternative to black that maintains high contrast with the white background for easy readability.

Accessibility and contrast considerations:

When designing the website, it's crucial to ensure that the color contrast ratios meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards. This will guarantee that users with visual impairments can easily access and navigate the site.

In this color palette, the primary color (Navy Blue) and secondary color (Sky Blue) provide sufficient contrast against the white background. However, the accent color (Coral) is used sparingly and with caution, as it may not provide enough contrast against the white background for some users.

Overall, this color palette provides a professional, engaging, and accessible experience for users, ensuring that the site's design aligns with its purpose and target personas.

![Colour Palette](https://github.com/BOM-98/project_1/blob/main/assets/images/README_images/colour-pallette-image.png) - TO CHANGE THIS IMAGE

### Typography

1. Primary Heading (H1):
- Font Family: Montserrat
- Reason: Montserrat is a modern, geometric sans-serif font that is both professional and friendly. Its clean lines and rounded edges make it suitable for both target personas, as it conveys a sense of clarity and approachability.

2. Secondary Heading (H2):
- Font Family: Open Sans
- Reason: Open Sans is a versatile, humanist sans-serif font with excellent legibility. It complements Montserrat well and works great for subheadings, making it easy for users to differentiate between content levels while maintaining a cohesive visual appearance.

3. Tertiary Heading (H3) and Body Text:
- Font Family: Roboto
- Reason: Roboto is a highly legible, neo-grotesque sans-serif font that was designed specifically for digital interfaces. Its readability and friendly appearance make it an excellent choice for body text and tertiary headings, ensuring that content is easily accessible to both target personas.

4. Accent Text (quotes, callouts, etc.):
- Font Family: Lato
- Reason: Lato is a warm, humanist sans-serif font that adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to accent text. It pairs well with the other font families and helps emphasize important information without detracting from the overall visual harmony of the site.

### Wire Frames
I created my wireframe using Balsamiq.

#### Home Page

The home page and Hero section were designed to provide a brief description of the Startup Academy with a call to action to sign up for the newsletter. In the implementation, a secondary CTA button was added linking to the articles.

![Wireframe1](https://github.com/BOM-98/project_1/blob/main/assets/images/README_images/home-page.png)

#### Blog Page

The blog page outlined the basic structure that would be used by the 'Ideation', 'Customer Discovery', and 'Fundraising' articles. It featured a header image with the page content section directly below and a sticky side panel for navigating to different article headings. The side panel will disappear once the user scrolls to the contact section. The blog page is finished off with a contact section.  

![Wireframe2](https://github.com/BOM-98/project_1/blob/main/assets/images/README_images/blog-pages.png)

#### Contact Page

The contact page is purely intended to get users to register for the website. An about page was going to be implemented underneath, highlighted in green, however, this was not implemented as there isn't a set location for the website. 

![Wireframe3](https://github.com/BOM-98/project_1/blob/main/assets/images/README_images/contact-page.png)

#### Thank You Page

The thank you page is arrived at as soon as a user submits a form on the website. It features a main image followed by a 'back to home' button to ease navigation back to the home page. 

![Wireframe4](https://github.com/BOM-98/project_1/blob/main/assets/images/README_images/thank-you-page.png)

### Sitemap

A sitemap was generated using [xml-sitemaps.com](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/details-bom-98.github.io-4988e25b7.html). This was added to the root directory. 

Here is a general overview of the Sitemap: 

- 1. [Home](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/)
- 2. Resources 
	- 2.1 [Ideation](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/ideation.html) 
	- 2.2 [Customer Discovery](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/customer_discovery.html)
	- 2.3 [Fundraising](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/fundraising.html) 
	- 2.4 [Blog Home](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/blog-home.html)
- 3. [Newsletter Signup](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/newsletter_signup.html)
- 4. [Thank You](https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/thank_you.html)

To rank the website on Google Search, a Google HTML file was added to the root directory (/workspaces/project_1/googleb4228df491edf6c8.html). I did not rename this file to something shorter and more readable as I was concerned about Google's ability to identify the file and verify the site if I did. 

A visual skeleton of the website is shown in the below image.

![sitemap](https://github.com/BOM-98/project_1/blob/main/assets/images/README_images/site-map-project-1.png)

The sitemap was uploaded to Google Search Console to improve page ranking on Google search.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

### Features Left to Implement

-   I would have liked to connect the newsletter forms to an actual mailing list to enable users to receive new content regularly. This would involve creating a backend database and APIs to collect and store the user information, in addition to integrating with mailing software such as MailChimp to email new subscribers. 
-  I would like to make a full blog editor where I can quickly add new blog pages with the same layout and style without having to manually create a new page by writing HTML and CSS. This would involve creating an admin page where I could write new articles and publish them to the site. Information on how to do this is provided in the following [link](https://dev.to/themodernweb/fullstack-how-to-create-a-working-blogging-website-with-pure-html-css-and-js-in-2021-9di.).

## Technologies Used: 

I used the following technologies, platforms and support in building my project: 

- I used [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), an extension within Visual Studio Code to visualize and test my website as I was creating it.
- Adobe Illustrator was used to edit the .EPS documents created by [catalyststuff](https://www.freepik.com/author/catalyststuff).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was the IDE used to create the website.
- [Github](https://github.com/) was used for the project repository.
- Git was used for version control.
- Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

## Testing

To ensure the site functions appropriately I conducted several tests. This includes HTML, CSS, and Javascript testing. 

### Validator Testing

-   HTML
    -   No errors were returned when passing through the official  [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbom-98.github.io%2Fproject_1%2Findex.html).
    ![W3Cvalidator](https://github.com/BOM-98/project_1/blob/main/assets/images/README_images/html-validator-check.png)
-   CSS
    -   No errors were found when passing through the official  [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fbom-98.github.io%2Fproject_1%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en).
    ![Jigsaw Validator](https://github.com/BOM-98/project_1/blob/main/assets/images/README_images/css-validator-check.png)
   - Page Performance
	   - Perfect 100% score across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices & SEO on [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-bom-98-github-io-project_1/fjiqdvj3km?form_factor=desktop).

### Manual Testing

- For each new page implementation
    - every page link was checked to make sure they redirected to the correct source.
    - every element was checked to make sure they were sized correctly and resized as expected with different screen dimensions.
    - external links were checked to make sure they opened a new tab and directed to the correct source.
    - forms were checked for defensive coding (field validation, error message for wrong input and mandatory fields) and correct submission redirects to the thank you page.
    - Google dev tools were checked to make sure there was no errors logged to the console for any Javascript functions that were invoked.
    - compatibility tests were done for different browsers.
- I received additional manual testing help on the #peer-code-review channel to make sure all links and javascript functions worked as intended.

## Deployment

-   The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    -   Before deployment, I edited my working directory using Visual Studio Code Remote Explorer. 
    - I added my files to the staging area using the 'git add .' command in the terminal.
    - Once files were added to the staging area, I committed my files using 'git commit -m 'my message'.
    - Once my changes had been committed, I pushed the changes to the remote repository using 'git push' in the terminal. 
    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
    -   From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
    -   Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful .deployment.

## Bugs / Issues

There was one notable issue that emerged during development. 

While attempting to implement form validation on the forms in each html page, I noticed that once I changed the "type" of an input from text to email, the label for the element would overlay on top of the input if it was not a valid input. This is not the best outcome in terms of user experience, as ideally the user would be able to view their input clearly to help them easily identify errors. To address this issue, I added a CSS property to the label for the input resulting in the label always clearing the input at all times, ultimately resolving the issue.

![Form Validation Bug](https://github.com/BOM-98/project_1/blob/main/assets/images/README_images/email-validation-bug.png).

## Credits

### Resources

- Codecademy provide a free online course [Introduction to UI and UX Design](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/intro-to-ui-ux/informationals/ui-and-ux-welcome) which taught me the basics of how to design prototypes on Figma. This came in very handy during this project as I wireframed by web app and thought through the color scheme and typography choices I had to make.
- Designing the website followed the [10 usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) from the Nielsen Norman Group to ensure my web app was easy to navigate, understand and learn from. 

### Layouts

- Inspiration for the hero section and the layout of the blog pages was taken from [Interneting is Hard](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/index.html).  A lot of the design was customized and not copied, in particular the hero section, however, the wireframe was initially inspired by the Interneting is Hard website design.
- General instructions on how to create a toggleable tab navigation section were taken from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp). The general logic behind the code was learned from this site, but the implemented version was highly customized and altered to suit the site. 
-  How to structure and style the logic form was taken from [Coding Stella's Codepen](https://codepen.io/codingstella/pen/LYJKQxB). Small adjustments to the form inputs and colour were added to the style. 
- How to create a sticky aside was learned from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sticky_header.asp). I reverse-engineered how the sticky navigation operated from that website and copied some of the element IDs - however, the section was styled very differently and javascript logic was added with event listeners to ensure the side navigation disappeared once the user scrolled down far enough on the site.
- How to generally style the cards used in the blog home page was learned from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp). The general layout for the cards was drawn from here, however, I had to use Flexbox to reorganize the elements within the cards and completely change the design.
- The scroll-to-top indicator code was found in [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp). I took this code and javascript and adjusted the styling to fit the branding of the website. The javascript was also adjusted to move all scripts to app.js instead of having inline javascript.
